# StudyRxjs

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.4.

You can access the project online here: https://gilvam.github.io/study-rxjs

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Deploy gitHub pages

To deploy the project directly to GitHub Pages, we use the `ng deploy` command with the `angular-cli-ghpages` package. Follow the steps below:

```bash
ng deploy
```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
